    "text": "1 Social Protection for Persons with Disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Protection for Persons with Disabilities\n\n\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which pledges to “leave no one behind,” is a bold global plan of action for a peaceful and prosperous world, based on the fundamental principle of human dignity and equality for all. It cuts across the United Nation’s three pillars of work: development, human rights, and peace and security. An important dimension of this agenda is promoting full and equal participation of all vulnerable and marginalized population segments, including persons with disabilities (PWDs).\nGovernments across the world are making concerted efforts to mainstream people with disabilities in all socio-political and economic aspects of life, as outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the CRPD. Pakistan adopted the CRPD in 2011 and is also a signatory to the Sustainable Development Goals, demonstrating the country’s commitment to protecting the differently-abled people’s civil, political, social, and economic rights.\nThere is mounting evidence globally that disabled people are disproportionately vulnerable to poverty (Banks et al., 2017). Disability is linked to both monetary and multi-dimensional types of poverty, with long-term effects for disabled people. Disabled people are more likely to face chronic poverty and social exclusion throughout their lives due to illiteracy, poor health, and limited labor market involvement. Furthermore, there are challenges to accessing social and support services such as education, health, and work for people with disabilities in general and in particular for the poorest segments. In this context, it is critical to integrate disabled people in national social protection systems, as stipulated in the SDGs.\nPRU has prepared a working paper to cater the needs of the most vulnerable segments of society through its programs, including persons with disabilities. However, a major hurdle in enrolling households with disabled persons in the Kafalaat program is the limited availability of SNICs of PWDs. The present procedure for getting a SCNIC from NADRA starting with getting the medical certificate of disability is a long one, due to which the majority of disabled persons, especially those from the poorest households are unable to get their SCNICs made. The One Window Centers being set up, in the first phase, access the federal and provincial capitals can play an instrument role in integrating the differently abled into different BISP programs. In order to holistically address the issue of disabilities, the BISP is developing a policy for integrating the differently abled into all existing programmatic interventions of BISP. This policy should also provide guidelines for including disabilities related concerns, as a cross cutting theme into the design of all future programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Survey on welfare options for people living in Jhuggis/ slums in Islamabad/Rawalpindi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelfare options for people living in Jhuggis/ slums in Islamabad/Rawalpindi\n\n\n\nIn the first phase of this exercise, the PRU team planned carrying out a sample based survey of households living in selected slums/ jhuggis in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. For this purpose, a short questionnaire was developed for collecting data from the surveyed households, which covered information on demographic characteristics, employment patterns and access to any form of social protection services by government agencies, including different programs of BISP. The questionnaire was designed to gather information on basic demographic characteristics of these households and the different forms of social protection services available to them, either from BISP or any other government run social protection program, such as Zakat or Bait-ul-Mal.\nIn order to draw sample of slums/ jhuggis in Islamabad, two slums were selected at random from the list of ten major slums in Islamabad published in a Report of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in 2019. In case of Rawalpindi, information on major slums/ jhuggis was collated from different sources, including published reports as well as information from BISP field office in Rawalpindi. On basis of this information, jhuggis in two areas of the city were selected for the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Impact Evaluation of Benazir Taleemi Wazaif\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact Evaluation of Benazir Taleemi Wazaif\n\n\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) launched in 2008 in the wake of the Global food and fuel price hike, has become Pakistan’s leading social safety net program. BISP’s main program is the Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) “Benazir Kafaalat”, which is currently being paid on a quarterly monthly basis to eligible ever married women in households falling under the defined threshold score on the proxy mean test (PMT).\nIn addition to its UCT program, BISP also runs the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program – Benazir Taleemi Wazaif (BTW) linked with improving educational outcomes of children in its UCT beneficiary households. This CCT prograrm was launched as a pilot in 2012 for promoting enrolment of children at primary level of education. It has recently been expanded at national level for facilitating enrolment of children upto secondary and higher secondary education, in all districts of the country. A quarterly stipend of Rs. 2,500/- for the boy child and Rs. 3,000/- for the girl child per quarter at secondary level and Rs. 3,500/- for the boy child and Rs. 4,000/- for a girl child at higher secondary level is being provided to Benazir Kafaalat beneficiaries of BISP on the basis on 70% attendance compliance of their children in school.\nIn order to determine the impact of enrolment of children at the secondary and higher secondary levels of education on the beneficiary households, the BISP CCT Wing intends to carry out an impact evaluation study of beneficiary households whose children have been enrolled in schools and/or colleges at this higher level of education.\nThe proposed study would have the following main objectives:\n\nTo assess increase in enrollment of program children at secondary and higher secondary level\nTo determine increase in school attendance at secondary and higher secondary level\nTo determine reasons for non-enrolment of children at secondary and higher secondary level\nTo understand gender dynamics of enrollment of children at secondary and higher secondary level To determine level of awareness of parents in beneficiary households about Taleemi Wazaif program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Population Dynamics of Pakistan using NSER data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Dynamics of Pakistan using NSER data\n\n\n\nThe study of the population structure of any country is vital for its socio-economic development and growth. Population dynamics include many factors including changes in the: size of the population in absolute number and rate of growth; age-sex structure of the population; average size of household; movement of people from one place to another; occupation distribution of the employed labour force; wealth status of the inhabitants; and family structure. In Pakistan, as in other countries, the main mechanism for studying the underlying population dynamics is the periodically conducted national population censuses which give an overview of the state of population in the country.\nIn Pakistan, the last Population Census was conducted some five years back in 2017. An opportunity for examining the population structure of the country using a more recent source of data is offered by the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER), which was updated towards the end of 2021. This data is part of the social registry maintained by the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), through which targeting of both unconditional and conditional cash transfers is carried out to the poorest households, based on the Proxy Means Test (PMT) score which ranks households on various dimensions of socio-economic welfare.\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Disability Prevalence in Pakistan using NSER data\n\n\n\n6 Expenditure and Consumption Patterns of BISP beneficiary Households using HIES 2018-19 data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditure and Consumption Patterns of BISP beneficiary Households using HIES 2018-19 data\n\n\n\nThe Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) – a regular survey carried out by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics after a gap of 2-3 years gives information on household expenditure and income, which is also used for calculation of the incidence of poverty in the country using the official definition of poverty adopted by the Government of Pakistan. Over time, the PBS has made improvements in the survey questionnaire and methodology to better capture living standards of households across Pakistan. One such addition to the HIES questionnaire was made in Section 8-M, which captures transfers received and paid out by enumerated households, where information on the annual transfers received through BISP were also included from the 2013-14 round of the survey onwards, along with information on other public social protection programs. The present paper makes use of the latest available round of HIES for 2018-19 to analyze household consumption expenditures as well as consumption patterns of households receiving BISP stipends and other households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Global Best Practices in Conditionalities in Conditional Cash Transfer Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Best Practices in Conditionalities in Conditional Cash Transfer Programs\n\n\n\nGlobally, over 60 countries operate conditional cash transfers (CCTs) programs. Conditionalities are requirements attached to cash transfer programs to encourage certain behaviors or outcomes. These requirements vary depending on the program, but they typically involve conditions related to health, education, or work. The CCTs aim to alleviate poverty by providing cash assistance to poor families and to reduce the intergenerational transmission of poverty by incentivizing investments in human capital, such as education and health, as well as increased productivity and income.\nRecent research indicates that in the short run, CCTs produce better human capital outcomes in comparison to unconditional cash transfers (UCTs). CCTs show better performance in terms of intermediate participation indicators (e.g., school enrollment or visits to health centers) and, to a lesser extent, human capital outcomes (e.g., learning achievement or health indicators), when compared with UCT programs. In addition, UCTs not only perform below par with CCTs in the short-term, but in the long run, even their positive short-run effects are not sustained.\nDespite the higher and more sustainable impacts of CCTs, there is substantial regional variation in the prevalence of conditional versus unconditional transfers, across low and middle income countries. A majority of Latin American countries employ conditional transfers; while cash transfer programs in Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia are mostly unconditional. On the other hand, a mix of unconditional and conditional transfers is in place in South and East Asia and the Middle East. The choice between adopting unconditional versus conditional cash transfers is dictated by a number of factors, namely the significantly higher financial and administrative costs of monitoring compliance with conditionalities under conditional programs as well as the availability of requisite human and institutional capacity and supply of quality social services at national and sub-national levels for effective implementation of conditional transfers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Social Assessment of Vulnerable Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Assessment of Vulnerable Groups\n\n\n\nVulnerability, as a measure, assesses the risks and uncertainties that individuals and societies encounter in terms of human development and sustainability. It allows us to identify weaknesses in different levels of human development and propose policies for fostering resilient development. The objective is to advance sustainable and secure human development. It is important to recognize that shocks experienced by vulnerable individuals or groups can have long-lasting or even intergenerational effects, particularly if the wellbeing of women and children is affected. Various international classifications and contexts exist to identify and categorize vulnerable groups based on specific criteria.\n\nMeasurement of Vulnerability – Frameworks used by International Development Agencies\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nShocks and threats to human development, Economic Insecurity, Inequality, Health risks, Environment and natural disasters, Food insecurity, Physical insecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Enabling role of financial literacy in poverty graduation through cash transfer programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling role of financial literacy in poverty graduation through cash transfer programs\n\n\n\nFinancial literacy has come to dominate the development and social protection literature in recent years. Financial literacy achieved policy salience in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis which was traced partly to consumers accepting financial products such as sub-prime mortgage without fully understanding the implications of their financial decisions.\nWithout a basic understanding of financial concepts, people are unable to make informed decisions about saving, borrowing, and investing with far-reaching implications for their economic wellbeing.\nSince cash transfer programmes are increasingly going digital, focus on both financial inclusion and financial literacy has also intensified as most of the beneficiaries of cash transfer programmes are women with low literacy and numeracy skills. This has been confirmed by many surveys of the global south. One survey in 2017 on financial literacy found financial illiteracy widespread across the globe, with huge variations according to population groups and countries. For example, women, the poor, and the less educated tend to have low financial literacy and financial knowledge.\nOn average, 55 percent of the adult population in advanced Western countries are financially literate compared to only 24 percent of adults in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) countries.\nThe long-range vision of cash transfer programmes is to graduate the poor from dependence on cash transfers through improving their skills in financial management, budgeting, account handing, and digital literacy as well offer vocational training. Such an approach not only can improve financial inclusion but also creates pathways out of poverty.\nBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee’s (BRAC) much-praised targeting of the ultra-poor is an example of a graduation focused programme which includes financial inclusion and financial literacy as its complimentary components.\nPRU in collaboration with UNDP prepared a Working paper on Enabling role of financial literacy in poverty graduation through cash transfer programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Dynamic Registries in social protection programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Registries in social protection programs\n\n\n\nAn increasing number of developing countries are adopting social protection programmes in recent decades These social protection programme offers a range of monetary benefits and services targeted at the neediest sections of the population. While monetary benefits are channelled through cash transfer programme This commonly shared phase along the delivery chains is accomplished through what is generally referred to as social registries defined as information systems that support outreach, intake, registration, and determination of potential eligibility for one or more social programs. As regards social registry’s inclusionary role, social registries enrol new applicants into programme through a wave of registration after a specified period or through continuous, on-demand registration.\nSocial registry incorporating on-demand and continuing registration element is called dynamic registry. Dynamic social registries also have the potential to serve as dynamic gateways for inclusion of the poorest and vulnerable whereby access to registration is kept open usually though on-demand application or continuous updating. Dynamic inclusion into social registries also conform to the universal social protection vision which encapsulates that ‘where anyone who needs social protection can access it any time’.\nBenazir Income Support Programe’s (BISP) National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) offer example of static social registry whereby the registry was created via en masses registration through sweep style census in 2011. Such registries require updating in line with the dynamic nature of poverty and vulnerability of the registered population to remain current and evolving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Grievance redressal mechanisms in cash transfer programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrievance redressal mechanisms in cash transfer programs\n\n\n\nIn recent decades social protection programme have increased across the developing world. While concerns persist about the vulnerability of cash-based social assistance programme to corruption along the delivery chain, there is no conclusive proof of cash transfer programme being more prone to corruption as compared to other social protection programme.\nGRM have been defined as the “formal institutions and channels people can use to express their dissatisfaction with service delivery and to demand redress. They can provide feedback to providers and policy makers about service delivery performance, and offer one route to hold service delivery providers to account. Effective GRM are known to speedily process and resolve received complaints, impose sanctions as well as protect whistle-blowers.\nIn Pakistan, since the roll out of the Benazir Income support programme in 2008 (now renamed the Ehsass programme) complaint handling mechanism has been in place. Various studies and evaluation of the GRM have identified some areas of improvements while appraising the system as well-functioning and incorporating elements of the best international practices. The evaluation of the Citizens Damage Compensation programme (CDPC) during the 2010 flood showed functioning grievance handling systems in place. Over the years, however, GRM has been further evolved in the light of various assessments.\nGrievance Redress Mechanisms in Cash transfer programme Global approaches and practices (First Draft) January 2022 was prepared by PRU in collaboration with UNDP"

This is the largest ever need-based undergraduate scholarship project in the history of Pakistan, which aims to address inequality in access to higher education. The Project envisages providing merit and needs-based scholarships over 4-5 years of under-graduate education, including tuition fees and stipend to cover living expenses, to the qualified undergraduate students from low-income families to study in HEC recognized public sector Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) of all regions of Pakistan, including Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\nHigher Education Commission (HEC) is the implementing agency for EUSP. BISP and HEC have entered into an agreement under a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the objective of working together to implement the EUSP. The eligibility criterion is need and merit based for all students in any of the public sector universities in the country. The students’ academic performance is monitored, and subject to satisfactory academic progress as scholarship recipients will continue to receive scholarship throughout their undergraduate program. All eligible students, i.e., those whose family income is below Rs. 45,000, are ranked in order of merit (i.e., their GPAs). A committee has been set up comprising Institutional Scholarship Award Committee (ISAC) assisted by a team of HEC to verify the income status and academic performance (GPA and attendance etc.) of the scholarship awardees.\nSince its launch in September 2019, scholarships to two batches of deserving students have been awarded in FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21. In Batch-I, 50,762 scholarships were awarded across the country through 119 public sector HEIs, while in Batch-II, 41,241 scholarships have been awarded by 129 HEIs across the country. Applications are now open for Batch-III to be awarded by the 135 partner HEIs of USP in FY 2021-22."

Over the span of 15 years, BISP has emerged as a beacon of hope, igniting change and bettering the lives of millions of vulnerable women and their families. It is with great pride and admiration that I introduce this book, “BISP: A 15-Years’ Journey from Inception to Globally Recognized Social Protection Vehicle”, which delves into the remarkable story of BISP. This book traces its origins, documents its evolution, and highlights the astounding achievements that have touched the lives of countless marginalized souls."

    "text": "1 Research Strategy for BISP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Strategy for BISP\n\n\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) launched in 2008 in the wake of the Global food and fuel price hike, has become Pakistan’s flagship social safety net program and is one of the largest programs in South Asia. The program has three primary objectives: a) enhance financial capacity of the poor and their dependents, b) formulate and implement comprehensive policies and targeted programs for the poor and vulnerable, and c) reduce poverty and promote equitable distribution of wealth, especially for low income groups. BISP is a statutory body established under the BISP Act 2010, that is overseen by a Board.\nBISP’s main flag-ship program is the Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) “Benazir Kafaalat”, which is currently being paid on a quarterly basis to eligible women in households falling under the defined threshold score on the proxy mean test (PMT). Through its Kafalaat program, BISP is serving over 8 million poorest families with cash transfers, making use of technologically advanced platforms and solutions. In addition, BISP also implements a range of other conditional and complementary programs for the poorest households across the country, which includes education-related conditional cash transfer (CCT) “Benazir Taleemi Wazaif” nutrition related CCT “Benazir Nashonuma” for BISP beneficiary women to increase the uptake of health and nutrition services by them and provision of scholarships to children from low income families for higher education under the Benazir Undergraduate Scholarship Project (BUSP). The targeting of the different BISP programs to beneficiary households is determined through the National Socio- Economic Registry (NSER) that was first developed in 2010-11 through a census like survey covering 85 percent of the country’s population. The new NSER survey for updation of the Registry has recently been completed and Registration Desks have been established in different tehsils for registration of missed out households.\nOver the years since its establishment, the BISP has become the leading program for translating the Government’s vision towards poverty alleviation and providing support to the poor and vulnerable population segments. BISP’s programatic interventions also directly contribute towards achieving impact on a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); which includes SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Knowledge Management System\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Management System\n\n\n\nKnowledge Management Systems can be used to systematically organize, store and digitize documents or any other digital asset like video or audio files, within an organization. Many organizations, both in the private and public domains, have implemented KM along-with tangible resources and assets in order to achieve improved performance. There have been many studies to substantiate the significance of KM across organizations in the recent years.\nBenazir Income Support Programme (BISP), the flagship social protection program of the country is serving over 8.0 million poorest families with monthly cash transfers, making use of technologically advanced platforms and solutions. In addition, it is also involved in delivery of conditional cash transfers for improving educational outcomes and health/ nutritional status of women/ children in these poorest households’ country-wide.\nThe Policy and Research Unit (PRU) earlier prepared a concept paper on development of a Knowledge Management System (KMS) for BISP, which highlighted the important role a KMS. It also facilitate information flows to internal and external users in a systematic and organized manner resulting in improved organizational efficiency. The concept paper was shared for review and feedback from all Wings of BISP which was appreciated by all the Wings.\nBased on the feedback received, a brief strategy document has been developed outlining the main features and framework for implementing a Knowledge Management System for BISP. BISP consists of several Wings which have essential documents and other forms of media. A KMS will allow users to share information within teams/Wings and externally between the Wings as well. Such a tool will facilitate processes of accessing, storing and sharing information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Agile Model of Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgile Model of Research\n\n\n\nAgile model for carrying out Action Research, including out-sourcing mechanism and through own staff\nPRU prepared two options for developing an agile model for carrying out action research, as required periodically by BISP operational wings. A tentative roadmap and feasibility of implementing both these options, in light of this is outlined below:\n\nHiring of third party firm(s) on retainer-ship basis\nUtilizing BISP field staff for carrying out action research on need basis"
